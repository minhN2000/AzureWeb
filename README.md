## Introduction

```
This is a small project that we work on deploying a web using Azure.

The web is about displaying the information that we analyzed from Kroger customer information
and their transaction which is gathered by 8451.
```
## Installation

All requirements libraries and frameworks are in `FlaskApp\requirements.txt`.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all of them.

```bash
pip install -r FlaskApp/requirements.txt
```
